<h2 id="Problem"><a href="#Problem" class="headerlink" title="Problem:"></a><u>Problem:</u></h2><p>The problem that we are aiming to solve with our application is the problem that emergency medical care takes too long of a time to arrive at the location of the emergency. Every year as more and more vehicles are on the road. It takes an increasing amount of time for the ambulance to reach its destination. Not only this, due to the Japanese mountainous geographical structure, there are many areas where helicopters need to be deployed instead of an ambulance, further increasing the time that it takes for help to get there.</p>
<p>This project helps create a safer and more connected community within the smart city by using technology to improve daily living. It enhances people’s quality of life by supporting public health and personal safety, especially for vulnerable groups like the elderly or people living alone. By detecting falls quickly and sending alerts to nearby individuals and emergency services, the project helps reduce response time and ensures that people get the help they need faster. This contributes to building a smart city environment where technology is used not only for convenience but also for protecting citizens and promoting a healthier, more supportive society.</p>
<h2 id="Proposal"><a href="#Proposal" class="headerlink" title="Proposal:"></a><u>Proposal:</u></h2><p>We propose developing a fall detection application that is on your phone. This application alerts nearby medical workers who set up accounts on the application after the user’s phone detects when your phone falls. At the same time, it also alerts emergency services to send help sooner and increase the chance of the person who took the fall surviving. While like the crash and fall detection that newer apple watches have, the difference is in the alerting healthcare workers area. In a large majority of cases, for example, In the case that someone stops breathing, CPR needs to be administered as soon as possible [1]. By getting a trained and licensed medical worker to aid until emergency services arrive, it greatly increases the chance for survival. The application also tracks the application users GPS location in order to alert the closest medical workers who have applied to the app but also the closest hospital in order to inform them about the incident that took place.</p>
<p>In addition to this, when someone has a heart attack or any other reason, there is a high chance that their body is not in a medical state that can call emergency services even when they need to. Annually, 680,000 people die from falls[2]. By making sure that medical aid arrives faster as well as making sure medical aid gets to the incident at all, our application can reduce this number.</p>
<p>Healthcare workers who apply to the application, will accept having their GPS data being shared, so that if a fall is detected near their current location, they will be alerted to the location of the fall as well as the victim’s previous medical history. To apply to the application, medical workers will give information such as their medical field as well as their job in the hospital.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there will be an AED location map on the application so that nearby people on the application can see where the closest AED is to the fall location. In all train stations in Japan there is an AED and with most cities in Japan being a 5 to 15 minute walk from the closest station, getting an AED is not a difficult task. A lot of the time the reason an AED isn’t taken is due to the lack of knowledge that they are publicly accessible at all times. For an AED to be effective, it needs to be administered 3 to 5 minutes after the victim’s heart has stopped moving, ideally even sooner[3]. By people being aware of the location of the AEDs they can be administered during the crucial moments after someone’s heart has stopped moving.</p>
<p>The application will also implement a personal medical profile for people who sign up. This is a separate profile from the healthcare workers profile and it is for the people who are the recipients of the help. The profile will show their basic information such as age, weight, height and sex and in addition to this basic information it will also show previous hospitalizations, allergies as well as extensive medical history as well as whether or not the patient has signed a do not resuscitate form. By making this information available it can help the people helping have a better idea of why the victim has collapsed.</p>
<h2 id="Overview-of-features"><a href="#Overview-of-features" class="headerlink" title="Overview of features:"></a><u>Overview of features:</u></h2><ul>
<li><strong>Fall Detection:</strong><br>Detects when someone falls in order to alert nearby medical workers as well as the closest hospital in order to inform emergency services as fast as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Static GPS:</strong><br>GPS of the closest hospital.</li>
<li><strong>Live GPS</strong><br>Live GPS tracking of the victim as well as nearby medical workers in order to administer aid as fast as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Fall Detection Model:</strong><br>A model that can differentiate between someone actually falling and someone who is just bending over or going to bed for example. We will do this by implementing both gyrographic as well as accelerometer data (if possible we will also implement barometric data).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Data"><a href="#Data" class="headerlink" title="Data:"></a><u>Data:</u></h2><p>For the data we have a few types. The first type of data is the data that the healthcare workers put into our application. The data includes name, age, working days, medical certificate and finally the hospital that they work in. </p>
<p>For the second type of data it is the fall detection data. This data consists of the acceleration data gathered by the smartphone’s accelerometer as well as gyroscope data. The gyroscope data is used to see whether the phone has actually fallen and the accelerometer data is used to see the speed and type of fall. Using the accelerometer data we can ensure that the phone’s gyroscope position changing is because of an actual fall and not someone sitting down, lying down, etc. The data for the falls are datasets that we got from previous research papers on fall detection [4][5] but the model is something we have developed. </p>
<p>One of the proposed datasets for this project is the MobiFall dataset [4], developed and maintained by the Hellenic Mediterranean University. The MobiFall dataset is well-regarded and has been cited in multiple research publications. While portions of the dataset are publicly available online, access to the complete dataset can be requested directly from the Biomedical Informatics and eHealth Laboratory at the Hellenic Mediterranean University. The dataset is well-structured, clearly labeled, and highly suitable for the objectives of this project.</p>
<p>Another proposed dataset is the FALLALLD dataset [6], which utilizes specialized sensors for data collection. This dataset has been referenced in several research publications and is recognized for its quality, having been published in the IEEE Sensors Journal. However, it may not be fully suitable for this project, as the data was not collected using a smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="Comparison-with-Existing-Solutions"><a href="#Comparison-with-Existing-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Comparison with Existing Solutions"></a><u>Comparison with Existing Solutions</u></h2><p>Our proposed emergency fall detection app differs from existing services like Coaido119, Medical Guardian, and Life360 in several important ways.</p>
<p><strong>Coaido119</strong> is an emergency notification app available only for iPhone users in Japan. It relies on manual operation when a user witnesses someone collapse or lose consciousness, they manually send a notification to nearby medical workers, facility safety managers, and 119 emergency services. Coaido119 also automatically alerts nearby facilities equipped with an AED, providing real-time location information along with video and audio of the situation. Additionally, it shows appropriate emergency consultation hotlines and nearby hospitals based on the user’s location.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Guardian</strong> is a wearable device focused mainly on elderly or health-vulnerable individuals. Once an emergency is detected, the device connects to a dedicated emergency response center. Operators attempt to communicate with the user and call an ambulance if needed. However, Medical Guardian mainly serves users with chronic health vulnerabilities rather than the general public and relies on a subscription service linked to its hardware device.</p>
<p><strong>Life360</strong> is a family and group safety app available on both iPhone and Android. It uses the phone’s built-in gyroscope, accelerometer, and microphone to detect car crashes automatically. When a crash is detected, Life360 sends an alert with the user’s location and situational descriptions to registered family members. Users can also manually trigger an SOS alert if they feel unsafe. Although Life360 offers direct contact with medical dispatchers, this feature is only available under a premium plan and limited to the United States. Life360 focuses more on general safety and driving incidents rather than health-specific emergencies like sudden falls or medical collapses.</p>
<p>In contrast, our project proposal aims to develop a smartphone based fall detection application designed to alert licensed nearby medical workers as well as emergency services when a fall is detected automatically. Unlike Coaido119, which relies on witnesses to manually report emergencies, our system uses the smartphone’s sensors to detect falls without any manual input. Once detecting a fall, the app sends an alert with the patient’s real-time GPS location and shares critical medical information such as chronic diseases, allergies, and current prescriptions with nearby registered healthcare workers. Compared to other services, our project enables users to register personal medical information to allow the first responders to provide faster and more informed care.<br>Overall, our project is designed to reduce fatalities from falls and sudden medical emergencies by combining automatic fall detection, professional medical intervention, and personal health data sharing to offer a faster response compared to existing systems.</p>

<h2 id="Challenges-and-Mitigation-Strategies"><a href="#Challenges-and-Mitigation-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="Challenges and Mitigation Strategies:"></a><u>Challenges and Mitigation Strategies:</u></h2><p>One challenge for our proposed fall detection application is ensuring the accuracy of fall detection. There is a risk of false positives, such as mistaking a dropped phone for a real fall, or false negatives, where an actual medical emergency is not detected. To avoid this, the application will combine data from multiple sensors such as the accelerometer and gyroscope to more reliably distinguish true falls from accidental drops. In order to achieve this, we will use machine learning techniques by learning from open source datasets of sensors. It is also essential to test the model by ourselves to improve the accuracy of the detection.</p>
<p>Another critical challenge involves addressing privacy and data security concerns, particularly because the application handles sensitive information such as the user’s GPS location and medical histories. By collecting only the minimal amount of data necessary to track the person’s location we will reduce the amount of data that we hold. In addition to this we will encrypt the location data </p>
